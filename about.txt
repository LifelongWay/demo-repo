Areas of file: modified | staged | committed


"staged file" - file that is ready to be committed(i.e added)

1) git status - lists files, 
     s.t
	 red - if waiting to be staged, 
	 green if staged

2) git add fileName - stage file
2.1) git add . - stage ALL modified files to staging area 
3) git rm --cached fileName -- remove file from staged

4) git commit -m "<Message>" fileName
5) git log  -- shows all different commits we have made
   s.t showing long string unique commit id
5.1) git log --oneline  // shows shortened one-lined commit history

/// undoing ///

1) checkout commit 
// to show code at point of time when particular commit was done 
// doesn't change commit history after checking out to earlier ones

2) revert commit 

// it undoes everything done in reverted commit
// then pushes commit "Revert <commit-id>"
// simply commits head with undone commit of <commit-id>
// NOTE: we still have access to undone commit ! 

3) reset commit <commit-id> 
// takes you PERMANENTLY back in time to a particular commit
// will delete all commits done later

// NOTE: though all commits after <commit-id> are removed,
// they are still present in unstaged area 
// and still editors have same data, just everything is unstaged!
