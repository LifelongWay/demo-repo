Ex: we want to add new feature, so we create a new branch for that( let's say "feature-c" branch).
If after that, someone changed master(main) branch, while we are working in "feature-c", we are unaware of that change in master(main).
Eventually, when we merge our "feature-c" into master => CONFLICT OBSERVED

i.e master branch was edited, while we were working in "feature-c" branch

error message will tell you:
1) file ,where conflict happened
2) ask to fix conflict, add and commit


CONFLICT CREATING LINE!
>>>>>>> feature-c
